<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

They would like a data engineer to build an ETL pipeline that extract their data from S3, stage them in Redshift, and transform data into a set of dimensional tables for their Analytics team to continue finding insights into what songs their users are listening to. The objective of the project is to create a data warehouse on cloud (AWS Redshift) and build the ETL pipeline to prepare the data for the Analytics team. 

Project Description :

In this project, the data engineer is required to build an ETL pipeline for a database hosted on Redshift. To complete the project, the data needs to be loaded from S3 to staging tables on Redshift and execute SQL statements that create the analytics tables from these staging tables.
